# ColorMine

spaces and comparing colors easy, originally by GitHub user
[THEJoezack](https://github.com/THEjoezack) in C#, forked on 2014-10-10.

PolyColorMine is a non-official port of ColorMine to Java by GitHub User
[zpolygon95](https://github.com/zpolygon95). PolyColorMine's creation is due to
the lack of existing libraries for java that intuitively trasform colorspace
coordinates, and perform accurate comparisons thereof.
